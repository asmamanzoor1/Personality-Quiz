# 🧽 Are You SpongeBob or Patrick? 🐚

This is a fun, lighthearted **personality quiz** I built during my **Girls Who Code internship** to find out:  
**Are you more like SpongeBob SquarePants or Patrick Star?** 🌊

Answer a few fun questions and discover whether you share more traits with Bikini Bottom’s most energetic sponge or its most lovable starfish.
